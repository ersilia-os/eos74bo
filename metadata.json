    "Title": "Aqueous Kinetic Solubility",
    "Description": "Kinetic aqueous solubility (μg/mL) was experimentally determined using the same SOP in over 200 NCATS drug discovery projects. A final dataset of 11780 non-redundant molecules and their associated solubility was used to train a SVM classifier. Approximately half of the dataset has poor solubility (< 10 μg/mL), and two-thirds of these low soluble molecules report values of < 1 μg/mL.",
    "Mode": "Pretrained",
    "Task": ["Classification"],
    "Input": ["Compound"],
    "Input Shape": "Single",
    "Output": ["Probability"],
    "Output Type": ["Float"],
    "Output Shape": "Single",
    "Interpretation": "It is a classification model which returns the probability of a compound having poor solublibity (>=0.5: low solubility), and probability of a compound being highly soluble (<0.5: high solubility)",
