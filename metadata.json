    "Title": "Aqueous Kinetic Solubility",
    "Description": "Kinetic aqueous solubility (\u03bcg/mL) was experimentally determined using the same SOP in over 200 NCATS drug discovery projects. A final dataset of 11780 non-redundant molecules and their associated solubility was used to train a SVM classifier. Approximately half of the dataset has poor solubility (< 10 \u03bcg/mL), and two-thirds of these low soluble molecules report values of < 1 \u03bcg/mL. A subset of the data used is available at PubChem (AID 1645848).",
